# Algonauts 2025 data exploration and visualization

## Background

Hey, I'm Max, a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Montreal.
All this brain stuff is very new to me: my entire university education is
in Computer Science.

## Objectives

My objectives are two-fold:

- First of all, while I do not have much knowledge about neuroimaging data, I have made
it an fundamental component of my thesis work in my predoctoral presentation ðŸ˜…. BHS is
for me an opportunity to start building some understanding of neuroimaging data.

- Second of all, I need to get better at plotting. Thus far, I've been fortunate that
the conferences that I have submitted papers to were not too demanding in terms of figure
quality, however I now better understand the value of very informative graphics and wish to
get better at producing them.

## What tools do I want to learn?

(Interactive?) Plotting libraries: Plotly, Dash, MyST, â€¦ 

## What data am I going to use?

The fMRI data in the Algonauts 2025 dataset

## What kind of deliverables do I want to implement?

Some nice notebook (ideally interactive) that gives me/others a better understanding of the Algonauts data but also fMRI data in general

## What kind of medium do I want to use to present the results?

Ideally an online interactive notebook website
